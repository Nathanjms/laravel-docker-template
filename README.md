## Docker Laravel Template

Docker template for [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) 12.


### Coolify deploy - extra steps:

Extra steps needed to deploy on coolify:

1. Create database on coolify (eg. mariadb)
2. Set the following in custom config:
```
[mariadb]
bind-address = 0.0.0.0
```
3. Create a new db user and database for the app, and grant permissions:
```
CREATE database `DATABASE_NAME`;
CREATE USER 'app-user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD_HERE';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `DATABASE_NAME`.* TO 'user'@'%';
```
4. Create the app on Coolify, choosing 'docker compose' as the build pack
5. Add the relevant env variables (eg. DB details with the user as above)
6. For the domain, add the port at the end, so eg. `https://example.com:8080`
7. Hit deploy and it should be up and running, check the logs for more details
